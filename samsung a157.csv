4, Mixed, We thought the phone was supposed to be new but it seemed refurbished. It arrived fairly quickly after we ordered it - maybe within the week. The phone worked with the SIM card we bought at 7-11. The only drawback was that the battery was drained after only about 12 hrs and a few short calls,,,,
5, Positive, The phone is slender and compact but has internet access. A good phone for the price and I would recommend the product. ,,,,
3, Positive, An easy to use basic phone that works on the 3g network. Voice and text are all that I use a phone for so it works great for me! ,,,,
1, Neutral, It's a very basic phone and it's what I paid for. Graphics are a little rough and usage is a little difficult. ,,,,
1, Negative, My plan for these phones was to take them home to Belize since they were unlocked,,,,
5, Negative, AT&T refused to activate the phones saying they were stolen from Walmart. Finally had to return the phones, I had to pay almost 75% of the purchase price to get them unlocked. Never buy AT&T unlocked phones, because they really are not, especially to use overseas," they will let you down. They should refund all my money back because it was misrepresentation. It stinks. """
4, Great Battery Backup , Great battery backup that keeps you going all day. The features are impressive,,,,
3, Positive, This is simply what I needed as a cellphone. Very satisfied. I recommend it to everyone who needs an easy phone to operate. THX !!! ," offering excellent value for money.""",,,
1, Positive, I needed a plain & simple phone. This one fits the bill. I suppose it has capabilities that I do not use (e.g.,,,,
1, Terrible Battery Life , The battery barely lasts a few hours, etc.). I do not have a phone plan that accesses those, nor do I need them. All I care about is that I can hear the person at the other end of the phone clearly; I can hear my phone ring; I can hear my voicemail messages; and, the person I am talking to can hear me. This phone satisfies all of those requirements without all the costly frills! So it is OK for people who do not wish to spend outrageous amounts of money on a phone that they will not use to: Take pretty pictures; text and drive; use while ignoring life going on around them up close & personal; IMing; GPSing; and whatever else these megabuck mini-communications systems do. If all you want to do is talk & be heard & to hear (NORMAL telephone conversation)," then this is the cell phone for you! """
