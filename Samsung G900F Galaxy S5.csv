1,"Now what is there to say about the galaxy S5 that has not been said in the specs already.I bought this phone for my wife's birthday. when it got here she was so happy.Its a original unlocked S5 so we took it to the provider and as soon as it got booted up we saw that it was in Chinese language, my wife got scared and said that it wasn't original.So let me explain this model is for Europe so the 2 languages that are preset are Chinese for some reason and English so we switch that quickly to English and started the activation process.Everything works fine if you have LTE in your area it works and if not it just switches to what ever network is available at your provider. its a blazing fast phone compared to the exynos version.we are located in the Caribbean for those of you that live near these parts and it works fine with our providers. no issues so far with the phone itself. Why i give it four stars and not five is the fact that nothing is perfect, don't get me wrong its a great phone it has all the bells and whistles but its too big for me.",
